# ðŸ›  UEBS Modded Unit Extractor

This is a simple Python script that collects all modded unit data from the **UEBS (Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator)** Steam Workshop folder and compiles it into a CSV file for easy use in Excel.  
Useful for unit comparison or tournament organisation.

---

## Setup

Run the python script with your desired workshop path
Default is set to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\1468720
This is where it usually is stored

## Default Workshop Path


Update the `workshop_path` variable in the script if your install is elsewhere.

## What It Does

- Loops trough your Workshop folder for files named `MODDATA-*.bgmod`

- Aggregates selected stats into a CSV file named `enemy_stats.csv`
